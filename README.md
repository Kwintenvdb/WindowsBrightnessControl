# Windows Brightness Control
A small tool to control monitor brightness on Windows.

Windows tends not to have a native brightness control for most external monitors. I wrote this app using WPF in an effort to resolve this frustration.

This app is a small tray utility that can be controlled with keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
* Control brightness using hotkeys
  * Hotkeys for increasing and decreasing brightness are available through settings window
* Control brightness using slider (press the taskbar tray icon to show)
* Configurable brightness interval
* Run the app on Windows startup

## To do
* First alpha release
* Add new icons
* Display current brightness over tray icon
* UI tweaks and animations (should be toggleable)
* Support multiple monitors
* Create installer and uninstaller
